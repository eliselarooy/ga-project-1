        Reversi, sometimes known as Othello is a strategy board game for two
        players.<br /><br />Each player takes turns in laying a counter on the
        board. The player's disc is laid in line with another of their counters,
        with their opponents counters in between. All the opponents counters in
        between the player's counters are turned to the their colour.<br /><br />Once
        all the squares have been filled, or neither player can make a move, the
        player with the most pieces with their colour face up wins.
